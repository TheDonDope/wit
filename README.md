# Wit - The Weed Information Tracker

Wit aims to help cannabis patients and users to manage and monitor their cannabis consumption and inventory.
It provides a CLI with a syntax which may seem familiar to users of git. :)

## Usage examples

### Not implemented yet

- `wit init <name>`: (Example: `wit init hindu-kush`) Create a new stash with the given `name`. A stash is the representation for a specific cannabis strain and its amount. You can think of it as the container where you keep your stuff in real life.
- `wit list`: List all existing stashes and their corresponding inventory weights
- `wit checkout <name>`: (Example: `wit checkout hindu-kush`) Switch to the stash with the given `name`
- `wit add <amount as floating point number>`: (Example: `wit add 12.0`) Add the given amount to the current selected stash. Note: Similar to git, after `add`-ing something, you also need to `commit`it and give a message, read on
- `wit commit -m "<commit-message>"`: (Example: `wit commit -m "add 30 day delivery for month may") Commits the changes to the current stash

## Planned features

- Tracking of consumption
- Inventory trend
- Graphs, graphs, more graphs

üîé **Smart, Fast and Extensible Build System**

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/web`
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/angular`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@wit/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to <http://localhost:4200/>. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `nx e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
